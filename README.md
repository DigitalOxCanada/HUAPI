# HUAPI
Health Unit API (currently built around Intrahealth Profile EMR)

Check out the Wiki for detailed information about this project.

The goal of this repo is to create a good starting point to implement an enterprise api for health related businesses.

# What you need
To use this repo you will need the Intrahealth Profile EMR product, a SQL instance, Visual Studio 2018 CE, .Net Core 2.1 SDK.

# Want to help?
We are looking for developers that would like to help make this API more complete.

# Other EMR Products
We would love to implement this solution with another EMR product.  If you have experience with another EMR product we would love 
to work with you on implementing that EMR into our API solution.
