    Logging in the HUAPI is using Serilog (<a href="https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Getting-Started" target="_blank">https://github.com/serilog/serilog/wiki/Getting-Started</a>) which by default outputs to the console.  Most users won't have access to the console on the server therefor the logs are also shipped to a central logging server that is running Seq (<a href="https://getseq.net/" target="_blank">https://getseq.net/</a>).
